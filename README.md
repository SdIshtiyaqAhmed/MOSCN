# MOSCN – Modern Operating Systems and Computer Networks

This repository contains coursework, assignment solutions, and related resources for a Modern Operating Systems and Computer Networks module. It showcases both theoretical tasks and C++ implementations that reinforce core OS concepts such as processes, scheduling, memory management, and basic networking.

## About the Project

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a learning and revision resource for operating system fundamentals and introductory computer networks. It combines written assignment documents with small C++ programs to bridge the gap between theory and hands-on practice.

## Contents

This project typically includes:

- Assignment descriptions and problem statements in document format.  
- C++ source files implementing selected tasks from the assignments.  
- Supporting artifacts such as course certificates that demonstrate completion and performance in OS-related courses.  

The exact organization may vary over time as new assignments, tasks, or resources are added.

## Technologies Used

- **Language:** C++ (for programming tasks and examples).  
- **Tools:**  
  - Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`, `clang++`).  
  - An office suite capable of opening `.docx` documents.  

## Getting Started

To explore or run the code:

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/SdIshtiyaqAhmed/MOSCN.git
- cd MOSCN
2. Open the assignment documents to understand the problem statements and requirements.  
3. Compile and run the corresponding C++ source files using a C++17-compatible compiler, adjusting file paths as needed:
- g++ -std=c++17 <path-to-source-file>.cpp -o program
- ./program


## Use Cases

- Revising key concepts from Modern Operating Systems and Computer Networks with concrete examples.  
- Using assignment solutions as reference material for academic study, labs, or interview preparation.  
- Showcasing coursework and learning outcomes as part of a personal portfolio.
